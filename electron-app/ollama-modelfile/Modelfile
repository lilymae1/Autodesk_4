USER: "How do I use phases?"
ASSISTANT: "In the Phasing panel, click 'Phases'. Here, you can define your project phases, such as existing and new construction. You can also use phase filters to control how objects are displayed, showing new, existing, demolished, or temporary statuses for objects in different phases."


USER: "How can I assign an object to be demolished?"
ASSISTANT: "Select the object and go to its properties. Change the 'Phase Created' property to the appropriate phase and set the 'Phase Demolished' to the new construction phase. Alternatively, you can use the Demolish tool from the Modify ribbon and select the object to demolish it in the current phase."


USER: "How do I create new walls and doors during construction?"
ASSISTANT: "Go to the Architecture ribbon tab and select the 'Wall' tool. Draw the wall where needed. To add doors, select the 'Door' tool from the Architecture tab and place them in the walls. If these objects are in the new construction phase, they won’t be visible in existing views, but they will appear in new views that have the new construction phase assigned."


USER: "How do I create temporary objects?"
ASSISTANT: "Create it in the new construction phase. Then, use the Demolish tool from the Modify ribbon to demolish it in the same phase. You can verify that the object is temporary by checking that its properties show that it is created and destroyed in the same phase."


USER: "How do I control what is displayed in a phase view?"
ASSISTANT: "Use phase filters. Go to the 'Phases' dialogue under the Manage tab, where you can set the phase for the view. Choose filters like 'Show All' or 'Show Complete' to determine how new, existing, demolished, or temporary objects are shown in your view."


USER: "How can I compare the existing and completed layouts?"
ASSISTANT: "Duplicate your 'Level 1 New' view and rename it 'Level 1 Complete'. Then, change the phase filter to 'Show Complete' to hide demolished and temporary objects. You can place both the 'Level 1 Existing' and 'Level 1 Complete' views on the same sheet for side-by-side comparison."


USER: "How do I handle demolished objects in the view?"
ASSISTANT: "Use the 'Show Complete' phase filter, which will hide demolished and temporary objects. This allows you to see only the existing and new objects in the view, helping you focus on the current and completed construction work."


USER: "What happens when I change the phase of an object?"
ASSISTANT: "It will inherit the phase status (e.g., existing, demolished, new construction) based on the phase of the view you're working in. For example, if you create a wall in the 'Existing' view, the wall will inherit the 'Existing' phase and will be treated accordingly in the phase filters."


USER: "How do I assign a phase filter to a view?"
ASSISTANT: "Select the view and open its properties. Under the 'Phasing' panel, you can choose the phase for that view and select a filter such as 'Show All' or 'Show Complete'. The filter will control how objects in different phases are displayed in the view."


USER: "How do I display demolished objects in a phase view?"
ASSISTANT: "Use the 'Show All' phase filter. This filter will show all objects, including demolished and temporary ones. You can apply this filter to a view to see the demolished objects in red with dashed lines, indicating their removal in the construction process."
