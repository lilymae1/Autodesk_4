USER: "How do I create duct systems to connect air terminals?"
ASSISTANT: "Once you have placed air terminal components in your Revit model, there are two methods to create the duct systems to connect them. The method you use depends on how you select the air terminals."


USER: "What’s the method to create duct systems?"
ASSISTANT: "Select a single air terminal with a duct connector. Then, on the contextual ribbon, click 'Duct'. Ensure the connector has the flow direction set to 'In' for it to behave properly in the duct system. In the Create Duct System dialogue, set the System type to 'Supply Air', enable 'Open in System Editor', and click OK. Then, on the contextual ribbon, click 'Add to System'. Now, in the drawing area, select any air terminals you want to add to your system, either individually or using an alternate selection method. Then, click 'Select Equipment' on the contextual ribbon and choose the fan coil unit serving your air terminals."


USER: "What’s the another method for creating a duct system?"
ASSISTANT: "Select all your air terminals first. Then, on the contextual ribbon, click 'Duct'. In the Create Duct System dialogue, select 'Supply Air' for the System type, enable 'Open in System Editor', and click OK."

ASSISTANT: "Is related to: https://www.autodesk.com/learn/ondemand/tutorial/place-air-terminals-in-revit"



USER: "How do I add components to my system after creating zones, spaces, and an air system?"
ASSISTANT: "Once you've created system zones, spaces, and an air system in Revit, you can add components like air terminals to the system. This exercise will show you how to place air terminals and set their space parameters for more accurate analysis results."


USER: "Why do I need to place air terminals?"
ASSISTANT: "Devices like air terminals are important because they provide data used in calculating the loads for the spaces in your duct system. This data tracks the supply, return, and exhaust air in each room, which helps you select the correct air terminal sizes."


USER: "How do I place an air terminal?"
ASSISTANT: "On the ribbon, go to the 'Systems' tab, then in the HVAC panel, click 'Air Terminal'. From the Type Selector, choose a face-based family type, like '12" x 12" Supply Diffuser – Square – Hosted'."


USER: "What happens after I select the air terminal?"
ASSISTANT: "When you select the air terminal, a Placement panel appears in the contextual ribbon. However, the cursor will show a 'cannot place' symbol unless it's over an appropriate host element. To fix this, click 'Place on Face' in the Placement panel, and then click the ceiling to select it as the host."


USER: "Do I need to select a different type of air terminal?"
ASSISTANT: "Yes, for this step, choose '24 x 24 Face 12 x 12 Connection Supply Diffuser'. This type is a non-hosted family, so the Placement panel won’t appear in the contextual ribbon. Set the level to 'Ground Floor' and the elevation to 9'-0", and then click the ceiling to place the air terminal."


USER: "What should I do after placing the air terminal?"
ASSISTANT: "Next, select the air terminal, go to the 'Modify' ribbon, and click 'Align' to align the air terminal to the ceiling grid. You can also adjust the visibility by deselecting the arrow parameters in the Properties palette to remove arrows from the view."


USER: "How do I check the airflow for the space?"
ASSISTANT: "Select the space where the air terminals are placed. Pay attention to the 'Actual Supply Airflow' parameter, which sums the airflows of all the terminals within that space."


USER: "What if the space isn't accounting for the airflow correctly?"
ASSISTANT: "If the space isn't accounting for the air terminal flow but your terminals are placed correctly, you can adjust the room calculation point to be inside the space. To do this, select the air terminal, click 'Edit Family' in the contextual ribbon, and make the necessary adjustments."
