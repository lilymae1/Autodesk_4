    'To create a wall from the point (0, 0, 0) to (10, 0, 0) in Autodesk Revit, you can follow these steps: \n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. Open your Autodesk Revit project and navigate to the desired location where you want to place the wall.\n' +
    `2. Go to the "View" tab and select "Wall" from the menu. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut 'W'.\n` +
    '3. With the wall tool activated, click on the starting point of your wall (0, 0, 0).\n' +
    "4. Next, click on the endpoint of the wall (10, 0, 0) to complete the wall's outline.\n" +
    '5. After you have outlined the wall, specify the height of the wall by double-clicking on it or using the Properties palette. For this example, set the height to 10 units.\n' +
    `6. Assign a suitable wall type from the Type Selector dropdown menu in the Properties palette. In this case, choose "Basic Wall". If you don't have a predefined wall type, you can create one by right-clicking on the Type Selector and selecting "Create Similar Wall Type" or "Duplicate".\n` +
    '7. Finally, assign the wall to the appropriate level in the Levels dropdown menu within the Properties palette. For this example, select "Level 1".\n' +
    '8. Press Enter or double-click outside of the wall to complete the creation process and add the new wall to your project.'
